# Contribution Guidelines

Adding your favorite material to this library is easy and very welcome.

## Which things am I allowed to add?

Since we want to maintain a high level of quality and limit the length of lists, please only submit entries that you personally read and found very useful.

This project only lists content that is publicly available and easily digestible (read, audio, video). We don't have a section for books as of yet.

Authors: Please don't submit your own work. This makes it harder to rate the validity of the suggestion for us. If it's a valuable work, you can always encourage another DevRel to submit it for you.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.

## Suggestions for project structure/improvement
